# OutsourceTracker.Common

Shared interfaces, enums, DTOs, and domain models for the **OutsourceTracker** ecosystem.

## Overview

**OutsourceTracker** is a set of tools designed to help independent (outsource) drivers working with **J.B. Hunt** better manage and track:

- Loads / dispatched work
- Gross pay, deductions, and net earnings
- Trailer assignments and utilization
- Settlement statements and payment history
- Miles, deadhead, and detention tracking
- Expenses, fuel receipts, and tax-related records
- Compliance & paperwork reminders

This **OutsourceTracker.Common** package contains the **core domain models**, **interfaces**, **enums**, **DTOs**, and **shared constants**

Keeping these types in a separate project ensures consistency, reduces duplication, and makes cross-project refactoring safer.

## Key Features / Contents

- **Interfaces** for major services & repositories
  - `IWorkService`, `IPaymentCalculator`, `ITrailerRepository`, `IUserContext`
- **Domain Models** & **Value Objects**
  - `Load`, `Settlement`, `Trailer`, `Driver`, `PayItem`, `Deduction`, `Expense`
- **DTOs** for API communication
  - `LoadSummaryDto`, `SettlementPreviewDto`, `PayPeriodSummaryDto`, etc.
- **Enums** & **Constants**
  - `LoadStatus`, `PayItemType`, `DeductionCategory`, `TrailerType`, `JbhDivision`
- **Calculation helpers** (pure functions / small utilities)
  - Mileage & pay rate calculations
  - Detention / layover logic
  - Fuel surcharge helpers
- **Custom exceptions**
  - `InvalidSettlementStateException`, `RateNotFoundException`, etc.
- **Attributes** & **annotations** used across projects
  - `[TrackChanges]`, `[SensitiveData]`, etc.

## Project Goals

- Single source of truth for domain language
- Zero external dependencies (or very minimal)
- High testability (most logic is pure / side-effect free)
- Semantic versioning compatibility
- Backward compatibility priority for driver-facing data shapes

## Installation
